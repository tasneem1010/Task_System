### Java Revision
- [x] Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- by defining data as objects e.g., Task
- [x] Encapsulation
- keeping class attributes private and using setter and getters to access them
- [x] Abstraction
- using an abstract class (e.g., Task) to maintain abstraction (generalisation)
- [x] Polymorphism
- having different implementations for each subclass for a method defined in a parent class (e.g., getType())
- [x] Inheritance
- implementing inheritance by having a general task class that is extended by different types of tasks
- [x] Access Modifiers
- using appropriate access modifiers (e.g., private for class attributes)
- [x] Functional Interfaces
- implementing a TaskFilter interface that contains one abstract method containing the filtering condition. 
- [x] Stream API
- processing data using .stream() (e.g., getSorted() and filterTasks() methods in TaskManager)
